The NFL Data Bowl is a competition where data scientists and sports analysts compete to create the best models and visualizations to predict the outcome of NFL games. Though we aren't competing in the competetion, they provide nice, cleaned datasets for us to use. These datasets cover a wide range of statistics and information about NFL games and players."

Players have cited the home crowd cheering them on as a reason for their improved performance. This is known as the home field advantage. At away games, players are often distracted with the chants and boos of a crowd. As a general rule of thumb, the home team is more favored to win than the away team. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. Some NFL players and teams perform better under pressure, and have better results away. Which teams are these? Let's find out."
